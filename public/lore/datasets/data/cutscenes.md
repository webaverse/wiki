MARIELLA and MAY quickly nod and rush off. 
COUNTESSA continues to stare at YONA. 
COUNTESSA: Do you know why they put me in charge of Brimstone Academy?
YONA shakes her head. 
COUNTESSA: Because a very long time ago there was a world without order, and where there are no rules, there is danger, chaos, and the most horrific, anarchy. And now we have order and compliance. All is well Safe and sound. So if I sense that someone is lingering around these halls wanting to disrupt the order we have worked so hard to build-

MR. OWL: The city's first architect. The one who built the very walls we know so little about. 
ZEKE: And I think I may find the truth in that book. 
MR. OWL: I'm afraid the book only opens when it is unlocked. And the key-

BOOST raises his black-gloved hand and opens it to find a SPARKLY IRIDESCENT SHARD. 
BOOST: Here you may find that along your journey people may trick you. Simply shine this shard in front of them. If the shard reflects green then their intentions are good, but if the shard reflects red, then you may not trust them. 
ZEKE: Why are you helping me?
BOOST: I am a part of a group, an anonymous group of protectors that watch this city. We maintain safety and the truth. It is not by a means of my own will to help you, but more an obligation to humanity. Now be safe, you never know what kinds of creatures could be lurking around the corner.
ZEKE retrieves the SPARKLY IRIDESCENT SHARD. 
He shines it in front of BOOST. A POWERFUL GREEN LIGHT emits from the crystal. 
ZEKE smiles and takes his eye off the shard as he continues to walk forward. 
The camera pans on the shard as it transforms into a MENACING RED.

SCOOT does a clean figure eight around ZEKE and LORNE. 
SCOOT: Let’s boogie! 

## Name:
The Power of Good Juice
## Description:
RHYDEN heals NESS’ wounds with GOOD JUICE. NESS confides in RHYDEN before LINUS and YONA return. 
## Script:
RHYDEN and NESS sit side by side on the cold sidewalk. NESS's legs are covered with scratches and bruises as she shivers. RHYDEN wraps his jacket around her. 
NESS: It’s just you all have something. Yona has her powers. You have your sword. And Linus is-
RHYDEN: Well he’s Linus. 
NESS: Exactly. I have nothing. I don’t have powers. I’m not good at fighting. And I’m not tiny and agile and quite frankly sometimes annoying. 
RHYDEN: Glad to hear you think highly of Linus. 
NESS emotes EMBARRASSMENT. 
RHYDEN unveils a GREEN LIQUID in an OLD PLASTIC BOTTLE. 
RHYDEN: Here drink this, it will make you feel better. 
NESS: What is this?
RHYDEN: Good juice. It will heal your scratches.
NESS takes the bottle from RHYDEN and begins to drink. 
NESS: Thank you.
NESS emotes DISGUST. 
NESS: Ugh! This tastes disgusting. 
RHYDEN: But look what it can do… 
NESS looks down and see’s the bruises and scratches miraculously disappear. 
NESS: How do you know so much about all this stuff?
RHYDEN: My brothers were top of their class at the academy. My father used to be a commander. 
NESS: Woah. Honestly, I’m so jealous of you. 
RHYDEN: There’s nothing to be jealous about. 
NESS emotes FEAR. 
NESS: After that fight with the robo dogs, I don’t think I can do this anymore. If I ran away, would you say anything? 
RHYDEN shakes his head. 
NESS: Well, until we meet again. 
RHYDEN emotes BITTERSWEETNESS
RHYDEN: I’ll be looking forward to it. 
Ness takes one last look at Rhyden before disappearing into the city walls.
