- > LINUS, YONA | ENTER THE CHAT. 
- Yona: Wheres Rhyden?
- Linus: He's ahead of us. He walks really fast. He does that sometimes. Sometimes I think it’s because he likes to be alone. Or away from me, I haven’t really figured it out yet. 
- YONA | EMOTES CONFUSION
- Yona: Oh well. 
- Linus: Sometimes my mother tells me my presence can too much to others, but I should live my truth. So here I am, LIVING IT! OWNING IT! 
- Yona: Gotcha…
- Linus: So you and Rhyden…
- Yona: Me and Rhyden?
- Linus: You two seem to be really close
- Yona: We have the same goal, to get to the end of the street. And once we get there, our mission is over. 
- Linus: Maybe… 
- Yona: Not maybe, that’s the truth. Once we get to the end of this road, we’ll never speak again. 
- Linus: Why?
- Yona: We won’t have a reason to. Just like maybe you and Rhyden won’t have a reason to. 
- Linus: Um, that’s not true, Rhyden and I are best buds. 
- Yona: Everything ends and people will always disappoint you. The sooner you realize that the better off you’ll be. 
- Linus: You really think he’d stop talking to me?
- Yona: shrugs. 
- Linus: Wow, I guess I never thought about it.

- YONA: What?
- JACKPOT: I’m afraid you cannot venture through these gates until you pay the fee. 
- YONA: A fee?
- JACKPOT: No fee, no way of getting into these gates.
- YONA: Who said?
- JACKPOT: I said, I am Jackpot, the guard of gates, I may never let anyone pass until a debt is paid. 
- YONA: Well that’s annoying! You don’t let anyone go unless they pay?!
- JACKPOT: I do not strive to be annoying, but it is my duty to the city. 
- YONA: The city gets richer on account of travelers.
- JACKPOT: The rules are sadly the rules. 
- YONA: You’re not getting richer?
- JACKPOT: No but I am upholding the law, something I take very seriously as the guard of my zone. 
- YONA: Some narc you are! 
- JACKPOT: Simply, pay the fee. 
- YONA: I’m not paying. 
- JACKPOT: Then you’re not crossing. Best to turn around and go back to whatever you were doing before. I’m sure it’s past your bedtime. Run along to your parents.

- NESS: I just like, I’ve worked hard to be where I am. I aced all of my classes. I am head of the student council. Most teachers love me
- YONA: You’ve lived your life as a walking brochure. 
- NESS: I’ve lived my life with order and discipline. Nobody has ever gotten out of these four walls. Not with Countessa here. 
- YONA: I think she’s secretly locking us in here to suck up our souls. 
- NESS: Don’t talk so loud! Someone could hear you! 
- YONA: Let them. This town is just the same as the next one. This zone is just the same as any other. But if we make it down that street we would be legendary. Not just in this zone, but in all of them.
- NESS: And if we fail? If the street never ends. We’ll be toast. I’ll lose my scholarship here for sure
- YONA: Oh you’re on scholarship? I didn’t know that. 
- NESS: It’s not something I like to share. 
- YONA: You’re right… maybe I should go alone. 
- NESS: And risk getting expelled?
- YONA: I have less to lose than you, so it would make me feel bad to put that on you. 
- NESS: You know what? Maybe you’re right. Perhaps if we get to the end, we would be legendary. 
- YONA: That’s the spirit! 
- NESS: Do you think there’s really an end?
- YONA: I read about it. I found a secret book tucked in a secret case in the library. I could show you if you want. 
- NESS: Wow, only you’re the first day you’re here and you already know all of the secret spots?
- YONA: I have a lot of free time.
