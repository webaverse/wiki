## Name:
The Street
## Description:
The Street is is a long (possibly infinite) object that runs through the center of the world and serves as a central transportation network, as well a geographic point of reference. The Street's appearance changes depending on where you are. The Street appears to continue indefinitely, though at some points the Street appears to cut off entirely before picking back up again. The Street appears to have always been present, and is a great source of mystery because nobody knows where it ends.
The Street is divided into [Zones](/lore/Zone) separated by [Great Filters](/lore/Great Filter), which are naturally ocurring formations that are difficult to cross. Each Great Filter is unique, and they tend to be dangerous and full of [Mobs](/lore/Mobs), so it is common for NPCs to build [Great Walls](/lore/Great Wall) to separate a Great Filter from the rest of the Zone for safety. Because communication across larger distances on the Street is hampered by the Filters, each Zone tends to culturally distinct.
Although there is migration across the Filters, data about far-off Zones tends to be unreliable, and in Zone 0 there isn't even agreement about what the furthest Zone to be explored is.
The Street tends to be a relatively safe place and a common place for building. However, danger increases as you move further to either side, and especially in the Great Filters.
Most Zones on the street have a [School or Academy](/lore/Schools) that is responsible for governance of the Zone.
