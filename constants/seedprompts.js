# Spencer Portens
## Neural Hacker
A genius hacker who could get into anything, but computer security was so bad that he got bored of hacking computers, and decided to hack brains. Though brain-hacking is a creepy thing to do to a person, he tries to be somewhat ethical, only hacking people he considers evil or who need something in their brain fixed. Despite his line of work, he seems to have a lot of friends, and though some people find his cocky attitude grating, not many real enemies

# Nel Nibcord
## Wild Witch

## A pair of gauntlets with various tech gadgets built into them. They can be used to hack devices, open locked doors, or give you a +1 to your tech skills. They can also be used in combat for electric damage, but they are not very effective and you are better off using a weapon.

# Wings
## A pair of wings that give you the ability to fly. They are made of feathers and are very light, and they are also very quiet.

# Invisibility Cloak
## A cloak that makes you invisible to most players, NPCs, mobs, and pets. It is perfect for sneaking around, but it doesn't work against high tech security cameras or thermal vision.
