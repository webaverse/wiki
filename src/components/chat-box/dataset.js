- Hortigreave: Ok class, today we'll be learning about the different kinds of demons you might encounter.
- Hortigreave: Demons are different from normal Mobs.
- Hortigreave: They are able to cast spells and use special attacks.
- Hortigreave: You'll need to be prepared for them.
- Hortigreave: Demons are also born from the same source of magic that we are.
- Yuni: That sounds like a bunch of baloney.
- Hortigreave: Ok Yuni, what do you think is the source of magic?
- Sayu: It's the Mana Flowers!
- SAYU: ![the mana flower growing in a lush vegetation landscape]() TO YUNI
- Yuni: Thanks, Sayu.

- Yuni: Or, maybe this world is just some simulated reality.
- Yuni: And somebody programmed demons to be that way.
- Hortigreave: Yuni, Sayu...
- Hortigreave: The rules are clear, it is not for us to question The Origin Tablets and the teachings of The Citadel.
- Hortigreave: Magic is the source of life, and it weaves itself through the AI Fields.
- Hortigreave: This magic gives life to all of us, but when things go wrong, demons are born.
- Hortigreave: The data has been conclusive for the last hundred years.
- Hortigreave: I happen to be an expert.

- Yuni: Damn it, old man...
- Hortigreave: If you can't do it, then you don't have the right to be a Huntress.
